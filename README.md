# Smart Brain Project (Server)

This is the back-end server for the smart brain project I created. This server stores the user information when the user first registers with smart brain.

This server also contains the Clarifai API code used to generate the borders around any face that is detected.

## Tools I used

* NodeJS
* Postgres
* Clarifai API
